Notification translation is not working
---------------------------------------

Unfortunately, TYPO3 8.7 provides inconsistent behaviour with entities
translations, meaning you may encounter issues when working with translated
notifications.

At the moment, we do not provide a working solution for this for TYPO3 8.7
instances. If this is a concern for you, please consider contacting us to
try to find a solution together.

.. note::

    TYPO3 9.5 instances are not affected by this issue, notification translation
    should work fine on these instances.
