TYPO3 â€“ Record created/updated
==============================

This event is fired when any record is created/updated within the TYPO3 backend.

You must select which record type will fire the event, for instance
``tt_content``.

If you selected ``tt_content``, you shall also filter which type of record will
be filtered by filling the filter field with a valid regex, for instance
``/text(pic)?/``.
