# Installation

You can install the extension via composer or the TER.

**Via Composer**

``` bash
$ composer require cuyz/notiz
```

**Via the TER**

You can download the extension at: https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/notiz/

Once you have installed NotiZ within the extension manager, you can directly go
to the list module and create new notifications.

If you don't know NotiZ yet, you can take a look at 
[this simple example](../Example/README.md).

You might want to take a look at the extension configuration to customize it, 
depending on your needs:
